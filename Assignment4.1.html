            <h1>Information technology</h1>
            <p><b>iInformation technology (IT)</b> is the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computers</a> to store to study ,retrieve, transmit, and manipulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">data.</a>or<a href=".."> information</a> , often in the context of a business or other enterprise.It considered a subset of<a href=".."> information and communications technology</a>(ITC). in 2012  Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level "contain[s] some degree of commonality in that they are related to<a href=".."> technologies</a> that facilitate the transfer of <a href="..">information</a>and various types of electronically mediated communications."[3]
                The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and <a href="..">computer networks</a>, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several industries are associated with information technology, including <a href="..">computer hardware</a>, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.[4][a]
                Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating <a href="..">information</a> since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC,[6] but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it <a href="..">information</a> technology (IT)." Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.[7]
                Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and <a href="..">electronic</a> (1940–present).[6] This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic), which began in about 1940.[citation needed]</p>
